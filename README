INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

IMPORTANT: Due the automatic generation of the pod-files, first of all
you have to run:
   make -C docs

This is a workaround until I'll have a better idea.

Then to install
   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

It is possible to add default value argumenting it to perl Makefile.PL:

e.g.

perl Makefile.PL --ConfigPath=/etc/arcx --DefaultPort=4242 --DefaultHost=arcdserv

Maybe this makes rpm & deb handling easier.
